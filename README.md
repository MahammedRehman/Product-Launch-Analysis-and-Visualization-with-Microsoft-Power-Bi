# Product-Launch-Analysis-and-Visualization-with-Microsoft Power Bi

I picked a real-world personal finance dataset from kaggle and cleaned it up for better readability.
Then, I used Power BI to visualize how different users earn, save, and spend.
I built a dashboard to answer: who can afford a product and where should we launch first?
The goal was to make complex data simple and actionable for product teams.

## Visualization

## Objective

To help companies identify high-affordability customer segments for launching products (e.g., groceries, digital services) by analyzing real personal finance data.

## Story Behind the Dashboard

This dashboard was built around a real-world scenario:

“A consumer goods company wants to launch a product. Who should they target and where should they launch first?”

I designed 3 dashboard sections to answer this:

| Section                      | Purpose                                                             |
|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  Target Segment Overview   | Understand user affordability across cities & occupations           |
|  Spending Behavior         | Identify top categories where customers spend money                 |
|  Affordability Simulation  | Test if a ₹2K/₹5K/₹10K product is affordable, and simulate outcomes with budget adjustments |


## Business Value
This dashboard supports data-driven product placement decisions, including:

- Prioritizing launch in **Tier 3 cities** (highest disposable income)
- Targeting **Professionals & Self-Employed** (higher flex budget)
- Adjusting pricing for **better affordability fit**

##  Chart-by-Chart Story (What Each Visual Unveils)

| Chart                                | Insight                                                                |
|----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Avg Disposable Income by Occupation    | Professionals & Self-Employed have more free cash after essentials       |
| Donut Chart (Occupation Mix)           | Students and retirees form ~50% of users, but have lower spending power  |
| Avg Desired Savings                    | Users want to save around 5K/month — this affects product affordability  |
| Expense by Category (Bar & TreeMap)    | Groceries, Rent, and Transport dominate spending                         |
| Affordability Gauge (2K/5K/10K)        | Only 36% can afford a ₹10K product → Pricing needs to be strategic       |
             


## Key Business Questions Answered
- **Which city tier has more spending capacity?** → Tier 3  
-  **Who has higher affordability & savings?** → Professionals, Self-Employed  
-  **Can we price a product at ₹5K?** → 65% can afford it, with room to optimize 

##  What Could Improve This Dashboard?

Great dashboards aren’t just answers — they’re evolving decision systems.

|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Occupation Sub-types                | More accurate targeting                          |
| Location (City/State)               | Geo-mapping for hyperlocal launch strategy       |
| Time Series Data                    | Enables trend analysis and seasonality forecasting
|  External Data Merge                | Adds market context to personal affordability
